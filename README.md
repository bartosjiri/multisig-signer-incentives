## Introduction

DAOs and other collaborative projects frequently utilize multisignature wallets to manage shared assets. Aiming for decentralization and safety, the adoption of multiple signers is a good practice to enhance decentralization by distributing responsibility and minimizing the risk of a single point of failure. Acknowledging the time and effort invested through the signer role, it is reasonable to also set up a signer incentive system.

However, it is not always clear how to fairly reward individual signers as information and experience on multisig setups from individual projects is scattered across the web, often hidden in long forum threads, governance proposals, or Discord channels. Therefore, the objective of this research is to compile the collective knowledge and establish an educational foundation for all existing and upcoming projects.
